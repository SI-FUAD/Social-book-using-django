# Social Book - A Django-Based Social Media Platform

**Social Book** is a full-stack social media web application inspired by platforms like Facebook. It allows users to create accounts, share image-based posts with captions, follow other users, like posts, track steps with a leaderboard, manage notes, and customize their profiles.

## 📎 Original Repository Reference

This project was originally developed collaboratively in a GitHub account that was created using the university g-suite account thus not refering to that directly as I am planning to use the personal Github account instead:  
🔗 [https://github.com/aurid07/django](https://github.com/aurid07/django)

My academic GitHub ID was `Shahidul-Islam-Fuad`, which is visible in the contributors list of the original repository.

## 📌 Final Note

This project highlights our first major full-stack Django development effort as a team. It accurately reflects our backend logic, feature scope, and frontend integration capabilities. This repository is a **retrospective academic upload** and is **not directly runnable without proper environment setup**. Required Django packages must be installed manually. This version is provided for demonstration and archival purposes only.
