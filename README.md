## 📌 Final Note

This project represents our first major full-stack web application using Django. While it is **not directly runnable without setting up a Django environment**, the repository provides a complete picture of the backend logic, feature set, and frontend integration we implemented as a team. All required dependencies and paths would need to be configured for it to run successfully in a new environment.
